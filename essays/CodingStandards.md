# Importance of Coding Standards

A smart way of asking a question contains providing a clear context, being detailed, and be DIRECT. It doesn’t matter what type of question you’re asking. To do that, you also need to know what kind of information you’re looking for and “WHO” is the best person to ask. Not knowing these two basic things is like bringing a knife to a gunfight. Remember, if you need an answer, you better know how to ask (the SMART WAY). After reading “How To Ask Questions The Smart Way” by Eric Steven Raymond’s, I realized the important things to consider when asking questions to get the RIGHT answers.

## What do I get and believe

I believe that practicing coding standards is a big help in learning a programming language. What did I say that? Practicing this can make a beginner programmer from ZERO to HERO in programming. This can accelerate their proficiency and implement coding structure that is both well-organized and/or well-designed.

## What do I think about ESLint and IntelliJ

After a week of using ESLint with IntelliJ, my first impression was it is not really going to work. I really hate it. Installing it was easy but setting it up was hard. But after some few days seeing its features, this really changed my coding style. The green checkmark, though seemingly simple, serves a huge help. It serves as a confirmation that my code aligns with the coding standards. It also helped me see which part is wrong and one cool thing I found out; it was it keeps auto suggesting! “Which is helpful” in someways. ESLint's implementation of formal or should I say technical consistency and detection of possible drawbacks has led to code that is more solid and a smaller number of errors.

## Conclusion

In summary, coding standards are the FOUNDATION of code quality. It helped me in formatting preferences and prompting the very structure of the program. Observing the coding standards adopts a culture of quality within my program and accelerates my language proficiency. My experience with ESLint and IntelliJ strengthens the idea that the green checkmark is not a symbol of inflexibility, but rather a bridge that guides me towards writing code that is both well-designed and efficient. Embracing the coding standards is not just a choice that I will choose, it is the LINT that I’d always want myself to be covered to craft a better version of myself on my way to software development and the quest of excellence.

In conclusion, asking smart questions is a vital part especially for us, programmers, because it allows us to get the closest and right answers they we should get to solve our problems. By being precise, understanding context, asking the right question, and thinking critically about the question we have, we can use other people’s deeper insights, knowledge, and foster meaningful connections within the community.
