  <h1 id="importance-of-coding-standards">Importance of Coding Standards</h1>

<p>Coding standards plays a big part of software development. While some people may find them as minor elements, I believe that if there’s one software engineering technique I learned, and still going to learn to improve the quality of programming, it should be coding standards. They serve as an “outline” for creating my code and building my program. Coding standards are not just for the looks, but it also makes things easy to understand and maintain.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-i-get-and-believe">What do I get and believe</h2>

<p>I believe that practicing coding standards is a big help in learning a programming language. What did I say that? Practicing this can make a beginner programmer from ZERO to HERO in programming. This can accelerate their proficiency and implement coding structure that is both well-organized and/or well-designed.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-i-think-about-eslint-and-intellij">What do I think about ESLint and IntelliJ</h2>

<p>After a week of using ESLint with IntelliJ, my first impression was it is not really going to work. I really hate it. Installing it was easy but setting it up was hard. But after some few days seeing its features, this really changed my coding style. The green checkmark, though seemingly simple, serves a huge help. It serves as a confirmation that my code aligns with the coding standards. It also helped me see which part is wrong and one cool thing I found out; it was it keeps auto suggesting! “Which is helpful” in someways. ESLint’s implementation of formal or should I say technical consistency and detection of possible drawbacks has led to code that is more solid and a smaller number of errors.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>In summary, coding standards are the FOUNDATION of code quality. It helped me in formatting preferences and prompting the very structure of the program. Observing the coding standards adopts a culture of quality within my program and accelerates my language proficiency. My experience with ESLint and IntelliJ strengthens the idea that the green checkmark is not a symbol of inflexibility, but rather a bridge that guides me towards writing code that is both well-designed and efficient. Embracing the coding standards is not just a choice that I will choose, it is the LINT that I’d always want myself to be covered to craft a better version of myself on my way to software development and the quest of excellence.</p>
