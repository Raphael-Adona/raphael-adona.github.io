From Zero to Hero : Back to my DREAMS

Things I’ve learned…. Back then
The beginning is always the hard part. It's been years since I last touched programming, specificaIly Java. I still remember how proficient I was back in 2010-2012 in the Philippines. I learned coding the hard way. No YouTube, no ChatGPT, and no access to helpful websites. I learned it the hard way. I had to go to classes every day, from 0730 to 1700. I did a lot of programs back then, so as projects. Fast forward when I moved to Hawaii, I had to start from the beginning for my academics. Most of my credits weren’t credited, and so I started with ESL and Basic Math. This prolonged my learning and stopped my GRIT from learning how to program again.

Motivations… for my future
Moving forward, this is my 2nd subject for computer programming. It’s been a while. From programming a student registration system, I felt that I am back to square one. Making myself my first Hello World in Javascript inside JSFiddle made something inside of me burn. I know I must follow my dreams. I must learn more, study more, and program more. 

Zero to Hero… Let’s start!
I am now taking ICS 314, and for the first time, I am excited again. I am excited to learn, especially from our WODS (Workout of the Day). I know it will take some time to get my programming skills back, it’s been 10 years ago! I know it is essential for me to do my responsibilities as a student, and manifest that from zero, one day, I will be a HERO again. I am eager to learn Javascript, work with different IDE's, and enjoy coding!
