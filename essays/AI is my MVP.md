# Introduction

Lately, AI-powered personal assistants have become a big part of our everyday lives. For example, a basic “Hello Siri” can help us do things easier without typing or even having to open our phones. AI is helping us with tasks and giving us answers. But as we use them more, some important questions come up about what's right and wrong. This essay will talk about how AI helped me through my journey in ICS 314. 

## Personal Experience with AI

In my class ICS 314, AI made a big difference. It changed how I learned and understood software engineering. AI tools, ways, and ideas helped me understand better, solve problems, and use software engineering in real life. ChatGPT helped me a lot. It's like a good friend. It explains things well and talks about hard ideas. It made learning more complete. I was hesitant to use this at first since I feel like I wouldn’t learn anything, but it ended up teaching me more. I was able to find problems easier to solve with ChatGPT’s help.

## Impact on Learning and Understanding

AI changed how I think about software engineering. AI tools like ChatGPT helped a lot. ChatGPT is great at explaining hard things and answering questions fast. It made understanding software engineering ideas easier.  But AI was hard at first. It took time to understand how AI works. When I got used to it, AI made understanding software engineering much better. But it does still requires you to learn the logic behind the code. It is not always 100% correct, so you still have to debug some of the codes that ChatGPT gives you or the answer it provided.

## Practical Applications
I saw AI help in real projects outside class. My recent projects and in my final project, I tend to ask ChatGPT if I feel like my code doesn't feel right. It showed how important AI is in our education, like it's important in work. At work, I do also use ChatGPT when there is questions that website doesn't answer properly. In my final project, I am planning to use ChatGPT more. Since all the files are complex in our final project, ChatGPT allows you to insert codes of the files you already made, and help you fix other files in the other folders aswell.

## Challenges and Opportunities
AI had good and bad things. Some people found it hard at first. But we learned how to use it better. We can make AI easier for everyone to use and learn.

## Comparative Analysis
AI ways helped me learn more than the usual ways. It's more helpful and fast. Sometimes, I do watch Youtube videos, and I prefer using ChatGPT since it is faster. It keeps me interested and helps me remember things better. I learned more and got better at using software engineering.

## Future Considerations
AI will help us more in the future. I know some people think that this is unethical, but time will come that we will start to adopt and embraces the changes that ChatGPT offers. It will change how we learn software engineering. We need to make AI better for everyone to learn and use. It should be easy and helpful for all kinds of learners.

### Conclusion

AI in ICS 314 was great. It helped me learn and understand software engineering. Using AI more in classes can help us learn better. We can make learning software engineering more fun and useful for people who want to do this in the future.
