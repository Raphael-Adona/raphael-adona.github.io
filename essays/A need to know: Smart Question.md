# Ask a question: The SMART Way

A smart way of asking a question contains providing a clear context, being detailed, and be DIRECT. It doesn’t matter what type of question you’re asking. To do that, you also need to know what kind of information you’re looking for and “WHO” is the best person to ask. Not knowing these two basic things is like bringing a knife to a gunfight. Remember, if you need an answer, you better know how to ask (the SMART WAY). After reading “How To Ask Questions The Smart Way” by Eric Steven Raymond’s, I realized the important things to consider when asking questions to get the RIGHT answers.

## What is the SMART Way?

In programming, asking a question is not a one-way street. A programmer needs to know the NEEDS before asking a question. According to Eric, a programmer needs to research, read, experiment, ask a skilled friend, and read the source code. Spoon-feeding someone with information leads to laziness and bad production. Once you ask a question, a SMART question in a SMART way, you must have initiative to put in effort to get the right and SMART answer/information you needed. For example, this [question]( https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77071412/how-to-handle-data-storage-in-cypress-e2e-testing) is SMART way of asking a question because it provided well-constructed and a clear context for the problem the user is facing with end-to-end (E2E) testing in Spring backend and Angular frontend using Cypress. It was mentioned the concerns about data storage, testing databases, and mocking HTTP responses, which are all relevant aspects to consider when setting up E2E tests. This kind of question is expected to have helpful responses because it was outlined correctly with the steps taken by the user to try and solve the specific challenges, and now looking for help on “what” is best approach to tackle them. It shows that the user thought about the problem, took initiative, thought about the process (which is important), and is now looking for expert advice. This is the SMART way to engage with a development community or forum.
