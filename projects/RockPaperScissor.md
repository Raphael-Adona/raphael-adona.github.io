Rock-Paper-Scissor is a 2-D game that I and my groupmates back in the Philippines created. This is not your ordinary Rock-Paper-Scissor! It comes with a twist! This is supposed to be downloaded by the users and be at the same room, at the same time!

To give you a hint about the TWIST, you should have a handkerchief ready. Someone is about to be blindfolded! This app is programmed to have a twist when you win, but the loser takes the consequences of the twist. This program has a lot of If-Else statement. I had to understand the concept of recursion. I had to communicated with my whole team who's going to do the coding, photo-editing, twist/consequences, and the program plan itself.

Imagine being blindfolded, how dark it could be? Imagine what is coming!
