Rock-Paper-Scissor is a 2-D game that I and my groupmates back in the Philippines created. This is not your ordinary Rock-Paper-Scissor! It comes with a twist! This is supposed to be downloaded by the users and be at the same room, at the same time!

To give you a hint about the TWIST, you should have a handkerchief ready. Someone is about to be blindfolded!
